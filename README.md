# JuliaSpectra.jl

This module provides code to simulate high-resolution molecular spectra and to compute properties of energy levels within a vibronic manifold. Right now, specific examples are programmed for linear and nonlinear open-shell radicals.

## Installation
The package can be installed by running the following command:
```
import Pkg; Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/benjaug/JuliaSpectra.jl")
```
Several example Jupyter notebooks show useful features for simulation LIF spectra and computing energy levels.
